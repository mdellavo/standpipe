# Standpipe

An aggregator and relay for AWS Kinesis Firehose streams.

Something you hook firehoses up to

## Design

Standpipe is a simple TCP client/server.  The standpipe client
will accept events written to it, encode and forward them to the server.
The standpipe server will aggregate events per stream and periodically forward to Kinesis Firehose.

The standpipe server is a simple threaded/evented server consiting of a network thread, a router thread and a number of upload worker threads.
The network thread is responsible for servicing the client sockets using poll(), decoding the messages and placing them on a queue for the router thread.
The router thread reads messages off the queue, slots them according to their stream and peridocially flushes the streams in batches to the worker threads.
The worker threads simply take batches of events from the queue and upload them to Kinesis Firehose.

The client server protocol is simply:

STREAM_NAME + " " + PAYLOAD + TERMINATOR

Events are not currently durable!
The client and server will buffer events in memory but will drop events if overloaded, does not currently provide back pressure.
